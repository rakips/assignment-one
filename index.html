                <h3> Mission </h3>
                <p>Before creating new content, determine what content you already have and where you see holes that
                    need to be filled. What content needs to be re-written? </p>

                <p>What pieces of content are performing well and may not need as much work? Document all of the content
                    you currently have and then identify what can stay, what needs to be refreshed and what needs to

                <h3> Goals </h3>
                <p>When creating website content, firms often think about what they want to say instead of what their
                    audience wants to read. It’s essential to create content for your website with your various
                    audiences in mind and think about what’s most important to them, since that is who your content is
                    truly for.</p>

            <h2>Develop <br> Without Limits</h2>
            <p> Your content should also lead visitors and prospects down the sales funnel. Your website should have a
                variety of content that addresses different questions or concerns depending on where the prospect is in
                the client journey, from awareness to purchase to advocacy.</p>

            <p> Having a solid website content strategy is critical in today’s digital landscape where search engine
                rankings and being discovered by prospects is driven by quality content. Not only will your content help
                people find your website, the quality and relevance of your content will make visitors stay and move
                through your site echnical staff and subject-matter experts are consumed with ongoing project work and
                new business pursuits and are expected to be billable for a large majority of their time. So making time
                to help marketing with content is often viewed as more of a favor to the marketing team, rather than
                part of their job description. With that sentiment, it’s best to start by getting executive leadership
                to buy into the strategic importance of content marketing and have them make content contribution for
                thought leadership as a priority for technical staff..</p>

                    involved, but go ahead and reiterate the power and possibility that their content carries.</p>
